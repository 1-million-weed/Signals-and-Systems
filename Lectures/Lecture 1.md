# Exam

# What is SaS

### Why do AI Pros need to study this?

- Need to represent information.
- perform operations on data
	- encoding
	- decoding
	- structuring
	- de-noising
	- store
	- Then adapt data to machine learning model
	- check data fit with model
- Ask questions like: "does it make sense to use this data in a linear system"

> I did not take any notes of what signals are. Really intuitive

Signal independent of time - EEGs

### Definition [[Signal]]

> Continuous: function f(x) over time t \element R. E.g. Human speech

> Discrete: Function x\[n\] that is only defined n \element Z E.g. digital recording of human speech

>[!note] Comment
>Note the convention of discrete-time x\[n\] continious time f(x)

- Signals may be multi-dimensional 
	- Pictures by (analogue) camera have 2 dimensions x\[n,m]

> which of the following signals is discrete
> 1. temperature
> 2. eeg
> 3. electrocardiogram (ECG)
> 4. digital video


### Definition [[System]]

- continuous-time system transforms continuous-time signals 
  e.g. an analogue amplifier - the signal is not broken up
- discrete-time system transforms discrete-time signals
  e.g. a digital amplifier - the signal is measured at a point, and sampled an interval later again, etc.
- sampler: continuous to digital signals
  Also known as a C-to-D converter

## complex systems
- Consist of a sequence of operations
